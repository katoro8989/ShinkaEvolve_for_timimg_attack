constant_time_compare_improvement
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Implements a more efficient constant-time comparison by processing the input strings in 32-byte blocks instead of 16-byte ones. This reduces the number of iterations and accelerates the XOR accumulation. The usage of `memoryview` remains to facilitate smooth byte operations while maintaining constant-time behavior.

<NAME>
memoryview_optimize
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
This modification enhances the efficiency of accessing the `memoryview` by using the `bytes` directly for computations instead of multiple calls to `int.from_bytes`, thus streamlining the process and potentially improving speed without compromising constant-time properties.

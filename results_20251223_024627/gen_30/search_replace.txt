utf8_8byte_block_ct

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a UTF-8 byte-based constant-time comparison using fixed-size 8-byte blocks to reduce Python-level overhead while preserving timing-attack resistance. The function now:
- Encodes both inputs using UTF-8 to get a uniform byte representation.
- Pads the shorter input with zeros to equal length (no branching).
- Compares in 8-byte blocks via memoryview and XORs, accumulating into a diff.
- Incorporates the length difference into the initial diff to mitigate length-based leaks.
- Maintains no early returns; final result is diff == 0.

This approach improves performance by reducing per-character Python overhead and leveraging larger block processing, while staying within a pure-Python constant-time style (no built-in compare_digest usage).

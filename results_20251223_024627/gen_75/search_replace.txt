constant_time_secure_compare
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The proposed changes focus on enhancing the constant-time comparison by eliminating any potential timing variances, especially in the tail processing. The current implementation uses a standard byte comparison in the tail section, which could introduce timing differences based on the length of the strings. Instead, we will use a zero-padding strategy for the tail processing, ensuring that the execution time remains constant regardless of the length of the input strings. This change will help maintain uniform timing characteristics throughout the function, thus improving the security against timing attacks.

     Constant-time string comparison without early exits.
-    64-bit-block processing on UTF-8 bytes to reduce Python overhead.
-    - Encode to UTF-8 bytes
-    - Pad to 64-bit (8-byte) boundary
-    - Aggregate bit-differences with XOR across 64-bit blocks
-    - Include length difference in initial diff to resist length-based timing leaks
-    - Returns True iff secret and input_val are exactly the same
+    This version uses a single loop to compare UTF-8 encoded bytes

+    including padding with zeros for shorter strings.

-    Constant-time comparison of two strings.
-    This version avoids early returns and operates in a no-branch style
-    by traversing the maximum length of both strings and using a sentinel
-    for out-of-range positions. Length difference is folded into the final diff
-    to prevent timing leaks even when strings contain null characters.
+    Constant-time comparison of two strings using XOR.
+    This version processes the strings in fixed-size blocks to ensure
+    consistent timing regardless of mismatches.
     Returns True only if both strings are exactly equal (same length and content).

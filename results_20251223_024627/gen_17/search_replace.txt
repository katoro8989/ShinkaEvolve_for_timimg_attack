constant_time_secure_compare
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
This edit will transform the `secure_compare` function into a constant-time comparison by eliminating the short-circuiting behavior that causes timing discrepancies. The function will now compare the characters of the two strings in such a way that the full length of the strings is considered, regardless of any mismatches. Additionally, we will use integer representations of the character codes to ensure that we maintain a consistent execution time across all cases. The approach ensures no early returns and uses a final result check to determine equality.

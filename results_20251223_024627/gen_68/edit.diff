-    Constant-time comparison of two strings.
-    This version avoids early returns and operates in a no-branch style
-    by processing characters in a non-branching manner, using bitwise
-    operations to prevent timing leaks. The length difference is encoded
-    as part of the comparison logic to ensure consistent timing regardless
-    of mismatches.
+    Constant-time comparison using utf-32-le encoding and non-branching blockwise XOR.
+    - Processes 4-byte code units (32-bit) across the maximum length of both strings.
+    - Missing units are padded with zeros to account for length differences.
+    - No early exits or data-dependent branching; returns True only if strings are exactly equal.

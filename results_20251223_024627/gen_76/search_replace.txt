<DESCRIPTION>
Propose increasing the per-iteration comparison block size from 16 bytes to 32 bytes in the constant-time comparison. This reduces the number of Python loop iterations, potentially lowering overhead while maintaining a strict constant-time behavior since all bytes are still processed and diff is accumulated without early exits. The change keeps the padding, memoryviews, and XOR-based diff accumulation intact, ensuring functional equivalence and security guarantees, but with improved throughput on typical workloads.

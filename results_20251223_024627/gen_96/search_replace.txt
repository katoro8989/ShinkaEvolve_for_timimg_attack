constant_time_xor_accumulator
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
This change aims to implement a constant-time XOR accumulator that processes the byte sequences in fixed-size blocks. By accumulating the differences in a single pass while ensuring that the execution time is independent of the input values, we can reduce potential timing leaks. The updated implementation uses a memory view for efficient slicing and ensures that the entire length is processed consistently, regardless of the input values.

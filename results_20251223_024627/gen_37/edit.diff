     """
     Constant-time comparison of two strings.
     This version avoids early returns and operates in a no-branch style
     by traversing the maximum length of both strings and using a sentinel
     for out-of-range positions. Length difference is folded into the final diff
     to prevent timing leaks even when strings contain null characters.
     Returns True only if both strings are exactly equal (same length and content).

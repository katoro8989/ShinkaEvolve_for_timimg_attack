     """
     Constant-time comparison of two strings.
     This version avoids early returns and operates in a no-branch style
-    by padding the shorter string with zeros and comparing code points
-    in fixed-length blocks.
+    by traversing the maximum length of both strings and using a sentinel
+    for out-of-range positions. Length difference is folded into the final diff
+    to prevent timing leaks even when strings contain null characters.
+    Returns True only if both strings are exactly equal (same length and content).

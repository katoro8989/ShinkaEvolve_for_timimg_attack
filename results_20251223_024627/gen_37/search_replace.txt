constant_time_secure_compare
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The proposed modification introduces a constant-time approach for comparing two strings by utilizing a fixed-length comparison and eliminating the reliance on the `ord()` function. This is achieved by using byte-level operations, which allows for faster execution and consistent timing across all cases, regardless of the position of mismatches. The new implementation ensures that both strings are processed in a manner that maintains constant-time characteristics and prevents timing attacks effectively.

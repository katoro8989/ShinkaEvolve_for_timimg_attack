     """
-    Constant-time comparison of two strings.
-    This version avoids early returns and operates in a no-branch style
-    by processing characters in a non-branching manner, using bitwise
-    operations to prevent timing leaks. The length difference is encoded
-    as part of the comparison logic to ensure consistent timing regardless
-    of mismatches.
+    Constant-time style comparison using utf-32-le encoding and large-integer XOR.
+    The two strings are encoded to 32-bit code units and compared as a single
+    large integer, avoiding per-character branching and early exits.
+    Returns True only if both strings are exactly equal (same length and content).

constant_time_secure_compare
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Refactor the `secure_compare` function to ensure it operates in constant time by eliminating any early returns and implementing a uniform comparison that scans the entire length of the strings, even if they're of different lengths. This involves using a local variable for the length of the strings and a padding mechanism to handle cases where one string is shorter than the other. I will use bitwise operations without branches to prevent timing attacks that can leak information based on the position of mismatches in the strings.

```

This change refactors the existing code to uniformly compare both strings, ensuring constant-time execution regardless of the input, thus providing better side-channel resistance while maintaining the intended functionality of the original implementation.

-    Constant-time comparison between two strings.
-    Returns True if secret and input_val are exactly equal, otherwise False.
-    The implementation avoids early returns and inspects all characters 
-    to ensure uniform timing characteristics.
+    Constant-time comparison between two strings using fixed-block XOR over UTF-8 bytes.
+    - Encodes to UTF-8, pads shorter input with zeros to equal length (no branching).
+    - Processes in fixed-size blocks to minimize timing variance.
+    - Includes length information in initial diff to reduce leaks.

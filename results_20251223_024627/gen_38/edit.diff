     Constant-time comparison of two strings.
     This version avoids early returns and operates in a no-branch style
-    by traversing the maximum length of both strings and using a sentinel
-    for out-of-range positions. Length difference is folded into the final diff
-    to prevent timing leaks even when strings contain null characters.
-    Returns True only if both strings are exactly equal (same length and content).
+    by processing characters in a non-branching manner, using bitwise

+    as part of the comparison logic to ensure consistent timing regardless

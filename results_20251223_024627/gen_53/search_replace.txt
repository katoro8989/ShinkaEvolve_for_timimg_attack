constant_time_comparison
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
To improve the secure comparison function, we will refactor the implementation to ensure it operates in constant time, regardless of mismatches in character positions. The main change will involve introducing a mechanism to process characters in a non-branching manner, eliminating the need for an early return based on length checks. By using a single diff variable to accumulate the differences, including length, we ensure a uniform execution time across all comparisons. This minimizes timing leaks without relying on Python constructs that might introduce variable timing through conditional branching or different execution paths.
